The false ceiling, TV unit, and wardrobe designs are simple yet elegant. The team was transparent about pricing from day one. My only minor suggestion would be to provide more material samples during the selection phase. Overall, great value for money and I recommend them for anyone looking for budget-friendly interior solutions in Nashik.",
